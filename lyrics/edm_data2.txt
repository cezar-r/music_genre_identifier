daftpunk|Giorgio by Moroder|When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician.  It was almost impossible because it was— The dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, was studying.  And when I finally broke away from school and became musician, I thought, "Well, now, I may have a little bit of a chance." Because all I really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music.  At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes.I think I had about 7-8 songs.  I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about—almost two years to survive, in the beginning,  I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, "Wait a second. I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?"  And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click. So, we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that it could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.  My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.  Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.|House

daftpunk|Instant Crush|I didn't want to be the one to forget I thought of everything I'd never regret A little time with you is all that I get That's all we need because it's all we can take  One thing I never see the same when you're 'round I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche" But no one gives us any time anymore  He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog You made an offer for it, then you ran off I got this picture of us kids in my head And all I hear is the last thing that you said  "I listened to your problems Now listen to mine" I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh  And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend 'Cause I know it unlocks like a door  And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away? Now I thought about what I wanna say But I never really know where to go So I chained myself to a friend  Some more again  It didn't matter what they wanted to see He thought he saw someone that looked just like me The summer memory that just never dies We worked too long and hard to give it no time He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall He cannot break it down or else he would fall One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore  "I listened to your problems Now listen to mine" I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh  And we will never be alone again 'Cause it doesn't happen every day Kinda counted on you being a friend Can I give it up or give it away?

daftpunk|Contact|Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby. It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing, it's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time. As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock, about maybe ten or twelve diameters. I don't know whether that does you any good, but there's something out there.|House

deadmau5|Seeya|Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head And maybe I'm weak but not beneath the covers of this bed Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine So let me stay inside this dream and keep me from the light  I've built this place behind my eyes you'll never see And you can move my body but please keep my mind asleep Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies  I, I feel it in my bones Escape, the world I know It's all in my control I, I just wanna stay this way Blood pumping in my veins I feel it, I feel it  Behind the darkness there's a sea of neon light And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality  It's not enough for me to paint with black and white Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life You think you've traveled far? You've never seen the stars Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far  I, I feel it in my bones Escape, the world I know It's all in my control I, I just wanna stay this way Blood pumping in my veins I feel it, I feel it|House

How come people part? How come people struggle? How come people break your heart? Break your heart, oh  Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I wanna feel Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up Heal it up, oh  See the forest, there in every seed Angels in the marble waiting to be freed Just need love Just need love  When the going is rough, saying  We're gonna get it, get it together right now Gonna get it, get it together somehow Gonna get it, get it together and flower We're gonna get it, get it together, I know Gonna get it, get it together and flow Gonna get it, get it together and go  But you can say what is, or fight for it Close your mind or take a risk You can say, "It's mine," and clench your fist Or see each sunrise as a gift  We're gonna get it, get it together right now Gonna get it, get it together somehow Gonna get it, get it together and flower We're gonna get it, get it together, I know Gonna get it, get it together and flow Gonna get it, get it together and go  We're gonna get it, get it together right now Gonna get it, get it together somehow Gonna get it, get it together and flower We're gonna get it, get it together, I know Gonna get it, get it together and flow Gonna get it, get it together and go  Up and up and up  Oh  Fixing up a car to drive in it again When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough Don't ever give up Don't ever give up  Believe in love|Alternative Rock
