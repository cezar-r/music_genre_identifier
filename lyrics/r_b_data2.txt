Without feelin' like Shallow Hal Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style Back in Cleveland city we ride around Greetin' my niggas wit' dap and pounds So if I fall I won't hit the ground These are the things that'll make me smile Knowin' this blunt might burn a while I keep myself so lifted I am accustomed to new heights I feel perfect though they think it's worthless See without my flight Man, everybody wanna be a critic I have my life and I will live it Shut your mouth before I fuck it Ha, my jokes they will love it If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans More than likely I am fadin' man Doin' other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin' round hatin' So, my advice is when the lights start flashin' I'll be zonin' all alone And then the place where my mind is goin' Filled with songs that no one's knowin' And the Devil in a hot pink dress tryin' to ask me for one dance He think he slick, but my guardians protect me from his wrath So, in my place no hate shall enter Livin' high up there, up there Copin' copin' floatin'  I will find peace somewhere  In my, mind sounds like oooooooh... When I'm gone it feels like oooooooh... When I zone, I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright When I zone, I'm feeling alright I'm feeling alright I forget about it all (all)|Hip-Hop
