taylorswift|Tim McGraw|He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie" Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin' stuck On back roads at night And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  September saw a month of tears And thankin' God that you weren't here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe  When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street And there's a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that you'll read is:  When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  Oh, think of me Mmmm  He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie"|Country
taylorswift|Picture to Burn|State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy <i>[Album version line:]</i> That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay! <i>[Music video version line:]</i> That's fine you won't mind if I say By the way...

taylorswift|Teardrops on My Guitar|Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see That I want and I'm needing Everything that we should be  I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about And she's got everything that I have to live without  Drew talks to me I laugh 'cause it's just so funny That I can't even see Anyone when he's with me  He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night  He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do  Drew walks by me Can he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be  She better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause  He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do  So, I drive home alone As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down And maybe get some sleep tonight  'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do  He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into  Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see|Country

taylorswift|Cold as You|You have a way of coming easily to me And when you take, you take the very best of me So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you  You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray And I stood there loving you and wished them all away And you come away with a great little story Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day So, just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you  You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you|Country

So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you.

taylorswift|Should've Said No|It's strange to think the songs we used to sing The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone Yesterday I found out about you Even now just looking at you feels wrong  You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."  You should've said "No", you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd Get back to me (get back to me). And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?" You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet... You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me  You can see that I've been crying And baby, you know all the right things to say But do you honestly expect me to believe We could ever be the same?  You say that the past is the past, you need one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."  You should've said "No", you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd, Get back to me (get back to me).

You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me  I can't resist Before you go, tell me this: Was it worth it? Was she worth this?  No... no, no, no...  You should've said "No", you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word 'Bout what you did with her'd, Get back to me (get back to me).

taylorswift|Our Song|I was riding shotgun With my hair undone In the front seat of his car He's got a one-hand feel On the steering wheel The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down He says, "Baby is something wrong?" I say, "Nothing I was just thinking How we don't have a song" And he says...  <i>[Chorus:]</i> Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have." And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen" Asking God if he could play it again  I was walking up The front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong And been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, Well, on my way To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice All the roses And the note that said...  Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have" And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen" Asking God if he could play it again  I've heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song...  'Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window When we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have" And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen" Asking God if he could play it again Play it again  Oh, yeah... Oh-oh, yeah  I was riding shotgun With my hair undone In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen And an old napkin And I wrote down our song|Country
taylorswift|I'm Only Me When I'm With You|Friday night beneath the stars In a field behind your yard. You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky. And sometimes we don't say a thing; Just listen to the crickets sing. Everything I need is right here by my side.  And I know everything about you I don't wanna live without you.  I'm only up when you're not down. Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. It's like no matter what I do. Well, you drive me crazy half the time; The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true. And I'm only me when I'm with you.  Just a small town boy and girl Livin' in a crazy world. Tryna figure out what is and isn't true. And I don't try to hide my tears, The secrets or my deepest fears. Through it all nobody gets me like you do.  And you know everything about me. You say that you can't live without me.  I'm only up when you're not down. Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. It's like no matter what I do. Well, you drive me crazy half the time; The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true. And I'm only me when I'm with you.  When I'm with anybody else It's so hard to be myself. And only you can tell...  ...That I'm only up when you're not down. Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground. It's like no matter what I do. Well, you drive me crazy half the time; The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true. And I'm only me Who I wanna be. Well, I'm only me when I'm with you, With you.|Country
taylorswift|Invisible|She can't see the way your eyes Light up when you smile. She'll never notice how you stop and stare Whenever she walks by.  And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her, But you are everything to me.  And I just wanna show you She don't even know you, She's never gonna love you like I want to. And you just see right through me, But if you only knew me, We could be a beautiful Miracle, Unbelievable Instead of just invisible.  There's a fire inside of you That can't help but shine through.

taylorswift|Fifteen|You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors It's the morning of your very first day You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while Try and stay out of everybody's way It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here For the next four years in this town Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say, "You know I haven't seen you around before."

taylorswift|Love Story|We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there  On a balcony in summer air.  See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns, See you make your way through the crowd, And say, "Hello." Little did I know...  That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, "Please don't go." And I said,  "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."  So, I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So, close your eyes, Escape this town for a little while. Oh, oh.  'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." But you were everything to me. I was begging you, "Please don't go!" And I said,  "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.  Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."  Oh, oh, oh.  I got tired of waiting, Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading, When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said,  "Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think." He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,  "Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.|Country

And you've got a smile That could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in a while Since she brought you down.  You say you're fine I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?  She wears high heels, I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain, And I'm on the bleachers.

I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made, And that was the first day.  And darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress, We had this big wide city all to ourselves. We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’, And for the first time I had something to lose, And I guess we fell apart in the usual way. And the story’s got dust on every page, But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. And I see your face in every crowd.  Cause darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,  It was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.|Country

But you’re so confused, 'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used. And all the young things line up to take your place.  Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.  And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.  It was a few years later, I showed up here. And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared, How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.

taylorswift|The Moment I Knew|You should've been there, Should've burst through the door, With that 'baby I'm right here' smile, And it would've felt like, A million little shining stars had just aligned, And I would've been so happy.  Christmas lights glisten, I've got my eye on the door, Just waiting for you to walk in, But the time is ticking, People ask me how I've been As I comb back through my memory, How you said you'd be here, You said you'd be here.  And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, As I'm looking around the room, But there's one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew.  And the hours pass by, Now I just wanna be alone, But your close friends always seem to know When there's something really wrong, So they follow me down the hall, And there in the bathroom, I try not to fall apart, And the sinking feeling starts, As I say hopelessly, "He said he'd be here."  And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, And asking me about you, But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew.  What do you say When tears are streaming down your face In front of everyone you know? And what do you do when the one Who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show?  You should've been here. And I would've been so happy.  And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all standing around me singing "Happy birthday to you", But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew.  Ooh, I knew. Ooh,  You called me later, And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it," And I said, "I'm sorry too," And that was the moment I knew.|Country
taylorswift|Come Back... Be Here|You said it in a simple way, 4 AM, the second day, How strange that I don't know you at all. Stumbled through the long goodbye, One last kiss, then catch your flight, Right when I was just about to fall  I told myself, "Don't get attached," But in my mind I play it back, Spinning faster than the plane that took you...  And this is when the feeling sinks in, I don't wanna miss you like this, Come back... be here, come back... be here. I guess you're in New York today, I don't wanna need you this way, Come back... be here, come back... be here.  The delicate beginning rush, The feeling you can know so much, Without knowing anything at all. And now that I can't put this down, If I had known what I'd known now, I never would have played so nonchalant.  Taxi cabs and busy streets, That never bring you back to me, I can't help but wish you took me with you...  And this is when the feeling sinks in, I don't wanna miss you like this, Come back... be here, come back... be here. I guess you're in London today, I don't wanna need you this way, Come back... be here, come back... be here.  This is falling in love in the cruelest way, This is falling for you when you are worlds away.  New York... be here. But you're in London and I break down, 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.  This is when the feeling sinks in, I don't wanna miss you like this, Come back... be here, come back... be here.

taylorswift|Mine|You were in college working part time waiting tables, Left a small town, never looked back. I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin' Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts.  I say, "Can you believe it?" As we're lying on the couch The moment I can see it. Yes, yes, I can see it now.  Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together, And there's a drawer of my things at your place. You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded, You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.  But we got bills to pay, We got nothing figured out, When it was hard to take, Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.  Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  And I remember that fight, Two-thirty AM, As everything was slipping right out of our hands. I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street. Braced myself for the "Goodbye" 'Cause that's all I've ever known. Then you took me by surprise. You said, "I'll never leave you alone."  You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water. And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine."  Hold on, make it last. Hold on, never turn back.  (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  (Hold on) Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now. (Hold on) And I can see it, (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now)|Country

taylorswift|Back to December|I'm so glad you made time to see me. How's life? Tell me how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while.  You've been good, busier than ever. We small-talk, work and the weather. Your guard is up and I know why.  Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind. You gave me roses and I left them there to die.  So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night," And I go back to December all the time.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I go back to December all the time.  These days I haven't been sleeping, Staying up, playing back myself leavin'. When your birthday passed and I didn't call.  And I think about summer, all the beautiful times, I watched you laughing from the passenger side. And realized I loved you in the fall.  And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".  So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night." And I go back to December all the time.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I go back to December all the time.  I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile. So good to me, so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night: The first time you ever saw me cry.  Maybe this is wishful thinking, Probably mindless dreaming, But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.  I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. So if the chain is on your door I understand.  But this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night." And I go back to December.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  I go back to December all the time. All the time.|Country

Don’t wait or say a single vow, Your time is running out, And they said, "Speak now."  Oh, la, la Oh, oh Say a single vow  I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." There’s the silence, there’s my last chance. I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me. Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I’m only looking at you.  I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl  <i>[Chorus:]</i> So, don’t say "Yes", run away now, I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. Don’t wait or say a single vow, You need to hear me out, And they said, "Speak now." And you say, "Let’s run away now, I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door. Baby, I didn’t say my vows, So glad you were around When they said, "Speak now."|Country
taylorswift|Dear John|Long were the nights When my days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor won't fall through Again  And my mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine  You paint me a blue sky And go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed the rules every day  Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight. Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why.  Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed With? The girl in the dress Cried the whole way home. I should've known.  Well, maybe it's me And my blind optimism To blame. Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love then take it away.  And you'll add my name To your long list of traitors Who don't understand. And I look back in regret. How I ignored when they said, "Run as fast as you can."  Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed With? The girl in the dress Cried the whole way home.  Dear John, I see it all now. It was wrong. Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played By your dark twisted games? When I loved you so. I should've known.  You are an expert at "Sorry" And keeping lines blurry. Never impressed by me acing your tests. All the girls that you've run dry Have tired lifeless eyes 'Cause you've burned them out.  But I took your matches Before fire could catch me. So, don't look now. I'm shining like fireworks Over your sad empty town.  Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. Don't you think I was too young to be messed With? The girl in the dress Cried the whole way home.  I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed With? The girl in the dress Wrote you a song. You should've known.

You, with your switching sides And your wildfire lies and your humiliation You have pointed out my flaws again As if I don't already see them I walk with my head down Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you I just wanna feel okay again  I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road And you don't know, what you don't know...  Someday I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?  And I can see you years from now in a bar Talking over a football game With that same big loud opinion But nobody's listening Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing But all you are is mean  All you are is mean And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean  But someday I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so?...  Someday I'll be living in a big old city (Why you gotta be so?...) And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...) Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...) And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?|Country
taylorswift|The Story of Us|I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us, How we met and the sparks flew instantly, And people would say, "They're the lucky ones." I used to know my place was the spot next to you. Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat, 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.  Oh, a simple complication, Miscommunications lead to fall-out. So many things that I wish you knew. So many walls up I can't break through.  Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.  Next chapter.  How'd we end up this way? See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy, And you're doing your best to avoid me. I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us, How I was losing my mind when I saw you here, But you held your pride like you should've held me.  Oh, I'm scared to see the ending, Why are we pretending this is nothing? I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how. I've never heard silence quite this loud.

This is looking like a contest Of who can act like they care less, But I liked it better when you were on my side.  The battle's in your hands now, But I would lay my armour down If you said you'd rather love than fight.  So many things that you wish I knew, But the story of us might be ending soon.  Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?

taylorswift|Back to December|I'm so glad you made time to see me. How's life? Tell me how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while.  You've been good, busier than ever. We small-talk, work and the weather. Your guard is up and I know why.  Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind. You gave me roses and I left them there to die.  So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night," And I go back to December all the time.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I go back to December all the time.  These days I haven't been sleeping, Staying up, playing back myself leavin'. When your birthday passed and I didn't call.  And I think about summer, all the beautiful times, I watched you laughing from the passenger side. And realized I loved you in the fall.  And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".  So this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night." And I go back to December all the time.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. I go back to December all the time.  I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile. So good to me, so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night: The first time you ever saw me cry.  Maybe this is wishful thinking, Probably mindless dreaming, But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.  I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. So if the chain is on your door I understand.  But this is me swallowing my pride, Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night." And I go back to December.  It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind  I go back to December all the time. All the time.|Country

taylorswift|Mine|You were in college working part time waiting tables, Left a small town, never looked back. I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin' Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts.  I say, "Can you believe it?" As we're lying on the couch The moment I can see it. Yes, yes, I can see it now.  Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together, And there's a drawer of my things at your place. You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded, You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.  But we got bills to pay, We got nothing figured out, When it was hard to take, Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.  Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  And I remember that fight, Two-thirty AM, As everything was slipping right out of our hands. I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street. Braced myself for the "Goodbye" 'Cause that's all I've ever known. Then you took me by surprise. You said, "I'll never leave you alone."  You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water. And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine."  Hold on, make it last. Hold on, never turn back.  (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine.  (Hold on) Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now. (Hold on) And I can see it, (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now)|Country

All those extended stays in Memphis, All the sleepless nights, the prayers, the tears.  It's just been one of those days, Where I was thinking poor me. I got no right to complain I guess, Cause right now all I can see.  Is that family moving back to Target House, It makes me realize. It's just been one those days for me, But for them its been one of those lives.  And so it's been one of those days, I let things get to me. I got no right to complain, Cause when I look around I see.  Folks that are fightin' for every breath, And it makes me realize. It's just been one for those days for me, But for them it's been one of those lives.|Country
bradpaisley|Toothbrush|Love starts with a toothbrush, A Bic razor and a Dixie cup A little splash of aftershave, Before you leave for that first date See stars in both your eyes After that long kiss goodnight  Forever starts with a suitcase, A Sneaking out the window getaway To the car parked by the curb, Gassed up for a Gatlinburg A little chapel and a couple of rings Will get you two toothbrushes by the bathroom sink  Everything that's anything Starts out as a little thing Just needs a little time and room to grow Step by step, day by day It all adds up along the way And the next thing that you know  Life starts with a little house, A corner lot on the edge of town A weed eater and a picket fence You think it's good as the getting gets Then she wakes up feeling bad You both wonder what's up with that  Everything that's anything Starts out as a little thing Just needs a little time and room to grow Step by step, day by day It all adds up along the way And the next thing that you know  One night around eight o'clock You scrub him down then you dry him off You pick him up and put his little feet On the stool by the bathroom sink You grab the crest and the Dixie cup It all hits you as he opens up... Love starts with a toothbrush|Country

bradpaisley|American Flag on the Moon|How do we honor Those who have fallen And died for this dream I'm sure of one thing It's not with gridlock Or bickering  We're the children of explorers We came here from every corner The adventurers that settled this land Lead the world, fought tyranny Touched the stars, brought liberty Let's do that again  Tonight I dare you to dream Go on believe impossible things Whenever anybody says There's anything we can't do I mean after all There's an American flag on the moon  Outside the other night You should've seen the moonlight It was enough to make you squint your eyes So my five year old had learned about The lunar landing and he walked out And started staring at the sky  Stood there for a while Got a great big smile and said "Dad I think I can see it, can you I bowed my head Closed my eyes and said Yeah, son, I think I do"  Tonight I dare you to dream Go on believe impossible things Whenever anybody says There's anything we can't do 'Cause after all There's an American flag on the moon  Oh, in two hundred years Think about all we've done so far I don't see any reason why tomorrow can't be ours  Tonight I dare you to dream Go on believe impossible things Whenever anybody says There's anything we can't do 'Cause after all, after all There's an American flag on the moon (On the moon)|Country

So if I'da known, I'da held on... A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose, Cause I still see you...  On a balcony over the sun In a chair by the rail, high above everyone We made love as the waves rolled in And we owned that town for one weekend.  Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand Like the sound of the boat Starting up, heading out of the bay Girl you... faded away.  On a balcony over the sun In a chair by the rail, high above everyone I watched you drive through the gate Without saying the words I needed to say.  Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand Like the tears on your face And the sun going down that day Girl you... faded away. You faded away.|Country

I’ll leave on the lights Baby you can crash my party anytime.  Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me. Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do. I could be on the front row of the best show. And look down and see your face on my phone. And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two.  <i>[Chorus]</i>  If it’s 2 in the morning And you’re feeling lonely And wondering what I’m doing...  <i>[Chorus:]</i> Go ahead and call me, call me, call me You don’t have to worry ‘bout it baby. You can wake me up in the dead of the night; Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright. This is a drop everything kind of thing. Swing on by I'll pour you a drink. The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights Baby you can crash my party anytime.  (Call me, call me, call me)  Baby you can crash my party anytime.|Country
