eminem|Stimulate|Psst... hey, listen!   Lalalalala! I love my job. Whoo! Makes me feel like Superman! Can you fly? I can. Wanna see?   Chorus  I'm only entertaining you  My goal is to stimulate, making you high  And take you and I  To a place you can't see  But I believe you can fly  I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying  I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian  Just a man who's on the mic  So let me entertain you...   Eminem  My lyrical content is constantly under fire  No wonder why I constantly bomb back  To combat attacks with constant concepts  When lyrics are constantly took outta context  Failure to communicate with congress has  Been a problem for the longest, I guess  But maybe one day we can make some progress  Food for thought - see how long it takes to digest  Feeling good when I should be ashamed  Sh*t, I really should've fell but I stood  See I came like a flame in the night  Like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light  There's a hope, there's a spark  But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye  Until they decide to set their differences aside  And this is why only one of us will survive  So children follow my lead and feel the vibe, cause   Chorus   Eminem  My music can be slightly amusing  You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing  Just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment  It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it  See I could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond  Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond  Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone,  Tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on  Constantly moving, constantly using the constitution  As a form of restitution  Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant  Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams  I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding,  World revolving, still evolving, still Slim  How many kids'll copy? Probably millions,  But I'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then, cause   Chorus   Eminem  My lyrical content contains subject matter  That sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids  At an alarming rate; common denominate  Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate  I try to stimulate but kids emulate,  And mimmick every move you make - "Slim, you great!"  But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?  I gotta be the one to go against the grain  Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane  For me to see you be influenced but pretend you ain't  But they don't understand that I've been through pain  If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain  But you can't just stand there and try to judge  It hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much  And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch  I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but   Chorus|Hip-Hop

coldplay|Square One|You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?  You're in control, is there anything you wanna know? The future's for discovering The space in which we're travelling From the top of the first page To the end of the last day From the start in your own way You just want somebody listening to what you say It doesn't matter who you are It doesn't matter who you are  Under the surface trying to break through Deciphering the codes in you I need a compass, draw me a map I'm on the top, I can't get back  Whoa whoa  The first line on the first page To the end of the last page From the start in your own way You just want somebody listening to what you say It doesn't matter who you are It doesn't matter who you are  You just want Somebody listening to what you say Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say It doesn't matter who you are It doesn't matter who you are  Is there anybody out there who Is lost and hurt and lonely too Are they bleeding all your colours into one? and if you come undone As if you've been run through Some catapult it fired you You wonder if your chance will ever come Or if you're stuck in square one|Pop-Rock

coldplay|Low|You see the world in black and white  No colour or light You think you'll never get it right But you're wrong. You might.  The sky could fall, could fall on me The parting of the sea But you mean more, mean more to me Than any colour I can see  All you ever wanted was love, But you never looked hard enough, It's never gonna give itself up  All you ever wanted to be Living in perfect symmetry, Nothing is as down or as up as us  You see the world in black and white Not painted right You see no meaning to your life You should try You should try  All you ever wanted was love, But you never looked hard enough, It's never gonna give itself up  All you ever wanted to be, Living in perfect symmetry, Nothing is as down or as up  Don't you want to see it come soon, Floating in a big white balloon Come give her your own silver spoon  Don't you want to see it come down? There for throwing your arms around And say "You're not a moment too soon."  Cause I feel low, cause I feel low ooooh... Yeah I feel low oh no...oooh Cause I feel low, cause I feel low oh... Yet I feel low oh no...oooh|Pop-Rock

coldplay|Swallowed in the Sea|You cut me down a tree  And brought it back to me And that's what made me see Where I was going wrong You put me on a shelf And kept me for yourself I can only blame myself You can only blame me  And I could write a song A hundred miles long Well, that's where I belong And you belong with me  And I could write it down Or spread it all around Get lost and then get found Or swallowed in the sea  You put me on a line And hung me out to dry And darling that's when I Decided to go to see you  You cut me down to size And opened up my eyes Made me realize What I could not see  And I could write a book The one they'll say that shook The world, and then it took It took it back from me  And I could write it down Or spread it all around Get lost and then get found And you'll come back to me Not swallowed in the sea  Ooh...  And I could write a song A hundred miles long Well, that's where I belong And you belong with me  The streets you're walking on A thousand houses long Well, that's where I belong And you belong with me  Oh what good is it to live With nothing left to give Forget but not forgive Not loving all you see  Oh the streets you're walking on A thousand houses long Well that's where I belong And you belong with me Not swallowed in the sea  You belong with me Not swallowed in the sea Yeah, you belong with me Not swallowed in the sea|Pop-Rock
